/**
 * WebFlux supports using a single value reactive type to produce the ResponseEntity asynchronously,
 * and/or single and multi-value reactive types for the body. This allows a variety of async
 * responses with ResponseEntity as follows:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>ResponseEntity<Mono<T>> or ResponseEntity<Flux<T>> make the response status and headers
 *       known immediately while the body is provided asynchronously at a later point. Use Mono if
 *       the body consists of 0..1 values or Flux if it can produce multiple values.
 *   <li>Mono<ResponseEntity<T>> provides all three: response status, headers, and body,
 *       asynchronously at a later point. This allows the response status and headers to vary
 *       depending on the outcome of asynchronous request handling.
 *   <li>Mono<ResponseEntity<Mono<T>>> or Mono<ResponseEntity<Flux<T>>> are yet another possible,
 *       albeit less common alternative. They provide the response status and headers asynchronously
 *       first and then the response body, also asynchronously, second.
 * </ul>
